# React + Vite

# Project Overview
This template serves as a minimal foundation for building React applications using Vite as the build tool. It comes with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) functionality and essential ESLint configurations for code quality.

# Available Official Plugins
Two primary plugins are supported in this setup:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md)
  - Utilizes [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) as the compiler
  - Enables Fast Refresh functionality for rapid development

- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc)
  - Implements [SWC](https://swc.rs/) as the compiler
  - Provides Fast Refresh capabilities
  - Offers improved build performance compared to Babel

# Enhanced Development Setup
For production-grade applications, we recommend:
1. Implementing TypeScript for better type safety
2. Enabling type-aware lint rules for improved code quality
3. Referencing the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for TypeScript integration
4. Incorporating [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) for enhanced linting capabilities

This setup ensures a robust development environment with proper type checking and code quality tools.
